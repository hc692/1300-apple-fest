The following set of interviews were conducted informally. The first is with an instructor from the music department who lives in Ithaca with his wife. He tries to make it to apple fest each year, and his responses come from his most recent visit this year. His main problems this year were overcrowding of popular booths by college students (cider donuts in particular) and difficulty parking due to construction. He did enjoy the nice weather and always has a good time supporting local businesses. When asked how he tends to plan his day, he mentioned being more likely to wander aimlessly than check a mobile app or plan via website beforehand. He did inquire whether nor not the mobile app would update throughout the day to reflect the arrival and departure of booths. 
Next, I interviewed the families of two friends whose parents are locals. Surprisingly, the first of the two had never been to apple fest. They expressed interest in planning ahead of time, as they do not already know what to expect. Their main objectives would be apples and cider. The second family claimed to have been to apple fest once "for a bit" in the past - unspecified time period. They mainly showed up to buy apples and cider, and to enjoy the festive atmosphere and free samples. Their youngest kid most enjoyed caramel apples and apple crisp. They weren't able to see any of the performances that day, and so they would be interested in a more organized performance roster as well as better publicizing. This is an area in which our website could come in handy.
